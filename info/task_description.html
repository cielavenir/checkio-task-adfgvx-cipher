    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher">ADFGVX Cipher</a>
    was a field cipher used by the German Army on the Western Front during World War I.
    ADFGVX was in fact an extension of an earlier cipher called ADFGX.
    Invented by Colonel Fritz Nebel and introduced in March 1918, the cipher was a fractionating transposition cipher
    which combined a modified Polybius square with a single columnar transposition.
    The cipher is named after the six possible letters used in the ciphertext:
    A, D, F, G, V and X. These letters were chosen deliberately
    because they sound very different from each other when transmitted via Morse code.
    The intention was to reduce the possibility of operator error.

    Let's learn this cipher with example.
    Our message is "I am going.". First, clean and process the message - "iamgoing"
    It should contain only latin letters in lowercase and digits. All other characters are skipped.
    Then fill "adfgvx" table with our secret alphabet "dhxmu4p3j6aoibzv9w1n70qkfslyc8tr5e2g".
</p>

<pre>
\  A D F G V X
 \------------
A| d h x m u 4
D| p 3 j 6 a o
F| i b z v 9 w
G| 1 n 7 0 q k
V| f s l y c 8
X| t r 5 e 2 g
</pre>

<p>
    Using this square, the message is converted to fractionated form (row-column):
</p>
<pre>
i  a  m  g  o  i  n  g
FA DV AG XX DX FA GD XX
</pre>

<p>
    Then, a new table is created with a key as a heading. Let's use 'cipher' as a key.
    A key should not contain repeating letters.
</p>
<pre>
c i p h e r
-----------
F A D V A G
X X D X F A
G D X X
</pre>

<p>
    The columns are sorted alphabetically based on the keyword and the table changes to the new form.
</p>
<pre>
c e h i p r
-----------
F A V A D G
X F X X D A
G   X D X
</pre>
<p>
    Then it is read off in columns, in keyword order and the result is "FXGAFVXXAXDDDXGA".
</p>

<p>
    You should write two functions - "encode" and "decode". Each function receives a message (ciphered or opened),
    a secret alphabet and a keyword.
    The "encode" function processes and encrypts a message. The "decode" function decrypts the encoded message
    (of course in the processed version).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. A message, a secret alphabet and a keyword as strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The processed message as a string.

    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
encode('I am going.', 'dhxmu4p3j6aoibzv9w1n70qkfslyc8tr5e2g','cipher') == 'FXGAFVXXAXDDDXGA'
decode('FXGAFVXXAXDDDXGA', 'dhxmu4p3j6aoibzv9w1n70qkfslyc8tr5e2g','cipher') == 'iamgoing'
    </pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This mission gives you a little practice in working with data structures and shows you how to use positional
    ciphers. Also you can use this cipher for your spy correspondence should you have no computer access.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    re.match("[a-z]+\Z", keyword)<br>
    re.match("[a-z0-9]+\Z", secret_alphabet)<br>
    len(set(keyword)) == len(keyword)<br>
    len(set(secret_alphabet)) == len(secret_alphabet)<br>
